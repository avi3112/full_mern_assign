//
getName();
console.log(x)
var x = 7;
function getName(){
console.log("hello avinabh"); }
//
In above code output will be below:

// this is basically call method
// let name1= {
// firstname:"avinabh",
// lastname:"kumar",

// // console.log(this.firstname+ "" + this.lastname)
// //}
// }
// let printfullname= function(hometown,state){
// console.log(this.firstname + " " + this.lastname+ " from " +hometown +" " + state)
// }
// printfullname.call(name1,"jamshedpur","jahrkahnd")
// let name2= {
// firstname:"sachin",
// last:"techndulkar",
// }
// function borrow
// printfullname.call(name2,"kolkata","kolkata") //apply()
// now lets talk about apply method
// here we call the argument in array list this is simple let name1= {
firstname:"avinabh", lastname:"kumar",
// printfullname:function(){
// console.log(this.firstname+ "" + this.lastname) // }
}
let printfullname= function(hometown,state){
console.log(this.firstname + " " + this.lastname+ " from " +hometown +" " + state) }
printfullname.apply(name1,["jamshedpur","jahrkahnd"]) let name2= {
firstname:"sachin",
last:"techndulkar", }
printfullname.apply(name2,["kolkata","kolkata"])
//bind method
// kind of similer to call method this will give copy of function we can invoke later let test= printfullname.bind(name2,"kolkata","kolkata")
test()
